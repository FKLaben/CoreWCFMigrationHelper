# CoreWCF Migration Helper

This repository contains 3 projects that illustrate the use of CoreWCF with .net Framework and .net Core. It illustrates the changes required to migrate a WCF service from .net Framework to .net Core.

## Content

Projects below depict a WCF IService usage:
* CoreWCFClient: A .net Core client
* CoreWCFService/CoreWCFServiceNetFramework: A .net Framework server
* CoreWCFService/CoreWCFService: A .net Core server

## Usage
Build projects as usual with Visual. Please note that Nuget dependencies should be automatically downloaded during this operation. Then, launch either the .net Framework or .net Core server. Eventually launch the client. Please note that as client does not display anything, you should launch it through Visual with a breakpoint to check that it successfully connected to the service.
